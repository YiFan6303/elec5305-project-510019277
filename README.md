# elec5305-project-510019277
# Comparative Study of Music Synthesis Techniques

## Project Overview
This project investigates **music synthesis** using two classic approaches:  
- **Additive Synthesis** – generating tones by summing harmonically related sinusoids.  
- **Frequency Modulation (FM) Synthesis** – using a carrier and modulator to create complex timbres.  

The goal is to compare these methods in terms of their **spectral characteristics, computational efficiency, and perceptual quality**. The project is part of **ELEC5305 – Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing**.

---

## Motivation
Music synthesis lies at the intersection of **digital signal processing** and **sound design**. Additive synthesis offers fine control over harmonic content, while FM synthesis efficiently produces rich, evolving tones. Understanding their differences provides insight into **modern synthesizer design** and highlights trade-offs between **control, efficiency, and timbral richness**.

---

## Methodology
- Implement additive and FM synthesis in **MATLAB**.  
- Shape sounds using **ADSR envelopes**.  
- Analyze harmonic content with **Fourier Transform** and **spectrograms**.  
- Compare methods using both **objective measures** (spectral centroid, bandwidth) and **subjective listening tests**.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- MATLAB code for additive and FM synthesis.  
- Audio demos showcasing synthesized tones.  
- Plots of waveforms, magnitude spectra, and spectrograms.  
- A discussion of strengths, limitations, and applications of each synthesis method.
