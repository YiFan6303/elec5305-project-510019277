# Comparative Study of Music Synthesis Techniques

This project investigates music synthesis as a concrete application of audio signal processing, with a head-to-head comparison between Additive Synthesis and Frequency Modulation (FM) Synthesis. Additive synthesis constructs tones by summing harmonically related sinusoids to control the spectrum explicitly, which is powerful for instrument-like timbres but can be computationally heavy when many partials are required. FM synthesis, by contrast, achieves rich, evolving timbres by modulating a carrier with a secondary oscillator; small changes in the modulation index and frequency ratio produce distinctive sideband patterns, offering high timbral variety with few parameters. Using MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox, I implement both approaches with configurable ADSR envelopes for temporal shaping and generate a suite of tones across pitches and parameter settings. All primary audio material is synthesized in MATLAB; where helpful for context, short reference snippets of real instruments may be used to illustrate similarities and differences.

Evaluation combines objective spectral analysis and listening-based judgments. I compute magnitude spectra and STFT spectrograms and summarize timbre with metrics such as spectral centroid, bandwidth, and a simple harmonic distortion proxy; I also record runtime to compare computational efficiency for matched target timbres. Informal listening tests (A/B comparisons) complement these measurements to assess naturalness and musical usefulness. The repository will include a documented MATLAB codebase (modular functions for additive/FM engines, envelope generation, batch rendering, and analysis), reproducible scripts to regenerate figures and audio, and a short comparative write-up discussing trade-offsâ€”control (additive) vs efficiency (FM), and predictable harmonic design vs emergent complexity. Expected artifacts are waveform/spectrum/spectrogram plots, WAV demos, and a concise discussion that links observed results to established synthesis theory, providing a practical, extensible baseline for future hybrids or real-time variants.
