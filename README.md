# Comparative Study of Music Synthesis Techniques

This project explores music synthesis as an application of audio signal processing, focusing on the comparison between Additive Synthesis and Frequency Modulation (FM) Synthesis. Additive synthesis builds tones by summing harmonically related sinusoids, offering precise control over harmonic structure but at a high computational cost. FM synthesis, on the other hand, achieves complex and evolving timbres efficiently by modulating a carrier with a secondary oscillator, a method that became widely adopted in commercial synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7. Using MATLAB and the Signal Processing Toolbox, this project implements both techniques, applies ADSR envelopes for dynamic shaping, and evaluates their outputs through spectral analysis (FFT, STFT) and informal listening tests. The expected outcomes include a documented MATLAB codebase, spectral plots, synthesized audio demonstrations, and a comparative discussion on the trade-offs between control, efficiency, and perceptual quality.
